										<h2>About me</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Picture 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Hello! I'm a 19-year-old computer science student at the University of South Wales.
										I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuously learning about innovative developments in the tech world.
										I enjoy diving into topics like programming, software development, and AI, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges that push my skills further.
										When I'm not coding or studying, I like exploring tech trends, collaborating on projects, and finding ways to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.
    									My goal is to develop cutting-edge solutions that can make a difference, whether it's through creating efficient software systems or working on groundbreaking technologies. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to growing as a professional in the dynamic field of computer science. </p>

										<h2>Skillset</h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Picture3.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my computer science course during the foundation year, I had multiple modules which taught me a range of skills such as python, Html, SQL and it
									    gave me an introduction to coding.
										This included setting up visual studio code and learning the basics of coding. I did website design and implementation with mainly HTML and a bit of CSS with Javascript 
									    I also practiced basic SQL in Microsoft access however progressing onto the next year I continue to expand my knowledge in SQL
										using Oracle Apex this year to create a database based on a restaurant. In my current year I also learnt C++ and am implementing it with small coding tasks to practice
									    certain features within c++ and the language itself.</p>

										<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Picture5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Personally, when I was younger I enjoyed gaming and using it to connect with others however as I have gotten older I have varied my interests 
										more to sports and other physically challenging activities also exploring features about different tech that can be useful and integrated with our lives to optimise certain areas. 
									    An example of this was researching the brand called Whoop which can measure useful metrics within our daily lives such as sleep quality and time. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Picture4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I have carried out multiple mini projects within both python and C++ that has helped progress in understanding both languages. 
									   I have also created 2 databases using SQL on 2 different softwares, one being Microsoft Access and Oracle APEX</p>
